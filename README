SYNOPSIS

    Lingua::Alphabet::Phonetic.

      use Lingua::Alphabet::Phonetic;
      my $phonetic = new Lingua::Alphabet::Phonetic('Password');
      my @phonetic_pw = $phonetic->enunciate('qOusiENi');

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a dictionary for Lingua::Alphabet::Phonetic. It allows
    for enunciation of passwords, using the following rules:

    * lowercase letters
        enunciated using the NATO alphabet per
        Lingua::Alphabet::Phonetic::NATO, but the word will be lowercased.

    * uppercase letters
        enunciated using the NATO alphabet per
        Lingua::Alphabet::Phonetic::NATO, but the word will be uppercased.

    * numbers
        enunciated as an initialcaps word for the english pronuciation of
        the number.

    * special characters
        enunciated as a mixedcaps word for the english punctuation of the
        character:

          @ At
          ? Question
          _ Underscore
          # Hash
          & Ampersand
          ! Exclamation
          - Dash
          * Asterisk
          + Plus
          = Equals
          " DoubleQuote
          % Percent
          ' SingleQuote
          ( LeftParens
          ) RightParens
          , Comma
          . Period
          / ForeSlash
          \ BackSlash
          : Colon
          ; SemiColon
          < LessThan
          > GreaterThan
          [ LeftBracket
          ] RightBracket
          { LeftBrace
          } RightBrace
          ^ Caret
          ` Backtick
          | Pipe
          ~ Tilde

    A character which does not fall into any of these categories is
    dispatched back to the base class for conversion. In the case of
    Lingua::Alphabet::Phonetic, this returns the character unchanged.

INSPIRATION
    This module was inspired by the web-based password generator at
    http://www.winguides.com/security/password.php. In particular, the words
    used for special characters are the same as used by that application
    whenever possible. Some translations, like the character "x" are
    different because this module uses Lingua::Alphabet::Phonetic to do the
    heavy lifting for alphabetic characters. In that module, "x" is rendered
    as "xray", but winguides.com reders it as "x-ray". C'est la vie.

    This module supports more special characters than the passwords which
    that application generates, so any liberties taken with these characters
    are my own.
